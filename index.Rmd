## About Me

My name is Celeste, and I am a second-year MHS student in Epidemiology. I am interested in spatial analysis 
and in studying environmental exposures. I am familiar with running statistical analyses in R and 
Stata, mapping in ArcGIS Pro, and managing data through Excel (Power Query), SQL, and RedCap. I 
have never used Git before! I am excited to gain more fluency in R through this course.
